# The PyScript User Guide

!!! info

    This guide provides technical guidance and exploration of the PyScript
    platform.

    While we endeavour to write clearly, some of the content in this user guide
    will not be suitable for beginners. We assume you already have Python
    or web development experience. If you're a beginner start with our
    [beginner's guide](../beginning-pyscript.md).

    We [welcome constructive feedback](https://github.com/pyscript/docs/issues).

Our docs have three aims:

1. A [clear overview](what.md) of all things PyScript.
2. [Exploration of PyScript](architecture.md) in substantial technical detail.
3. Demonstration of the features of PyScript working together in
   [real-world example applications](../examples.md).

_Read this user guide in full_: it is a short but comprehensive overview of the
PyScript platform.

Get involved! Join in the PyScript conversation on our
[discord server](https://discord.gg/HxvBtukrg2). There you'll find core
developers, community contributors and a flourishing forum for those creating
projects with PyScript. Should you wish to engage with the development of
PyScript, you are welcome to contribute via 
[the project's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/pyscript).

Finally, the example projects referenced in our docs are all freely available
and copiously commented on [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com).

!!! note

    Many of these examples come from contributors in our wonderful
    community. We love to recognise, share and celebrate the incredible work
    of folks in the PyScript community. If you believe you have a project that
    would make a good demonstration, please don't hesitate to
    [get in touch](https://discord.gg/HxvBtukrg2).
